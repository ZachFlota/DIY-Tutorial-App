# editGuideViewPage.html and editGuide.css Info and Usage

"editGuideViewPage.html" is a seaprate page from the main "viewGuides.html". 
when clicking the edit guide link in the nav bar it will send you to editGuideViewPage which will have an edit button below each guide. this button will take you to the edit guide form page.
"editGuide.css" is for this page specifically but can be used in place of the "viewGuides.css" if we just want a single viewguides page with edit buttons. 

just have to change the edit guide link target on all html pages to "viewGuides.html" and the target css in the "viewGuides.html" code to "editGuide.css" if we want to just have the edit buttons on the viewguide page.
